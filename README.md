# React Todo

## Learning Objectives
- Build a todo app in React that persists with a backend
- Use React Router to deep link
- Use axios promise library to retrieve data from a back end
- Pass state from parent components to children as props
- Pass state from children components to their parents as arguments to functions

## Framing
At some point in every developer's formative journey to greatness, they must build at least one Todo app. Once complete you will be able to create, read, update, and delete your todo items in addition to having our Todo app talk to a database. We'll be combining all the topics we've discussed so far with React, including props, state, React router, and making network requests to a server where our todos will be stored.

## React Todo
Alright it's time to build! We're going to be building this application from scratch! It won't be exactly like the solution-code directory above, but it'll be pretty close and follow much of the same structure.

> If you get behind, all code written today will be in the lesson plan. The error messages you'll get in terminal and in the chrome dev tools from React are usually very accurate and helpful, so please utilize them. Please keep questions pertinent to content. We should also note that some of the code snippets will be repetitions to reiterate points of learning. Some of them might just be updates to existing files. Some of them might be brand new content you have to add all of.
